Version 1.3.1
-------------

Improved xray CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `--test-execution-name` was renamed by `--test-execution-summary` cli option.
With this option, now the title of the test execution ticket can be set or updated properly.

The `--test-execution-id` was renamed by `--test-execution-key` cli option,
to be aligned with Jira naming.

see :ref:`xray`
