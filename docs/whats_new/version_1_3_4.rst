Version 1.3.4

Improved xray CLI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the `--test-execution-description` and `--test-execution-summary` cli options,
the description and summary of the test execution ticket can be set when creating a new ticket
or can be updated if the ticket is already created.

It is now possible to upload the test results from all the tests functions with the decorator xray,
included the test functions named ``test_run``.

see :ref:`xray`
